# link-showcaser
Just displays a link.

## How to use
Add a hash (#) to the end of the URL, and then after the hash, put the URL you want to link to.

For example:
```
https://kccuber-scratch.github.io/link-showcaser#github.com
```
## Status
Currently is kinda broken on dark mode, and it will create a link regardless of whether it is actually a link.
